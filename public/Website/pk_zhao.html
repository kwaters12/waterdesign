Thinking that it would only be an afternoon's work, I said sure. So, I went in and met her. She gave me these photos of the film's star, Mr. Winston Chao (趙文瑄), and said that they wanted his cartoon likeness to be designed for a t-shirt that would appear as a prop in the movie. This gallery shows how I went from simple 2D sketches on the first day, to a 3D model, back to cartoon characters for the final."class="ilightbox3" ><img src="images/projects/pk_zhao/pk_zhao1_b.jpg"></a></div>
