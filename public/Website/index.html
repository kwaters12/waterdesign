Thinking that it would only be an afternoon's work, I said sure. So, I went in and met her. She gave me these photos of the film's star, Mr. Winston Chao (趙文瑄), and said that they wanted his cartoon likeness to be designed for a t-shirt that would appear as a prop in the movie.

                    data-caption="I worked at a startup called Mingleverse Laboratories for the summer of 2009. There I made 20 or so different 'mingleroom' designs. Mingleverse was meant to be an alternative to Skype or other video-conferencing software. However, it seems to now have gone under. I am including this project to show my process in creating a Mingleroom because it took a lot of problem solving to get to a final room."class="ilightbox9" ><img src="images/photo_b.png"></a>

                    data-title="How did it work?"
                    data-caption="This image is what Mingleverse would have looked like from an external perspective. It was a browser-based conferencing service. Using Flash's 3D capabilities, the coders created a six-sided enironment where people could interact. Using 3D sound meant that there could be upwards of 20 people in a room each having their own separate conversations. As well, it could be used to share media on the walls of the room. It was very interesting, but I think the idea was a little too complicated for most people to understand."

                    data-caption="These next slides will show how I created a room. I was given 2-3 days for each room. I first started by creating a relatively detailed model of the scene in Maya.  This was my favourite one to work on, the Richmond Olympic Oval, which was built for the 2010 Winter Olympics. It's just a beautiful building, so I was excited to make my quick interpretation of it." class="ilightbox9" ></a>
